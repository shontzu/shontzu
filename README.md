  <h2>Doing a case study research on e-portal usability to troubleshoot user-retention issue on <a href="https://pathforge.co/feed/">Pathforge</a></h2>
  <p align="justify">
  Founder and co-founder of <a href="https://hackercollective.co/">The Hacker Collective (THC)</a>, Ming Yu Kee and Deric Yee did user persona research to understand why people joined THC. 85% said they joined for the community and projects. The rest joined for the content and learning material. As big believers of self-learning, the vision for the Hacker Collective is; anyone can learn programming and technology, to disrupt overpriced education, to get all the self-learners together on a single platform so that everyone can collaborate on projects, meet like-minded people, network with other self-learners, with no geographical boundaries. This led to them (and some other Hacker Collective developers) to develop a social-educational portal called Pathforge.

  <p align="justify">
  The goal of Pathforge is not to create content (i.e. not to be another Coursera, Udemy, or FreeCodeCamp). Rather, to curate contents and provide community support for self-learners. Research shows that the main reason for online learning to fail is due to isolation. This motivated the developers to emphasize social and gamification elements in their portal.

  <h2>What is usability testing</h2>
  <p align="justify">
  SUMI is a rigorously tested and proven method of measuring software quality from the end user's point of view to gauge the relative idea of “usability” from a student's perspective.
  The advantages of e-learning systems are minimized if students do not use them, causing e-learning initiatives to often completely or partially fail despite their potential. Low performance and poor usability create unusable systems which are probably the single largest reason that they fail in actual use.

  If you think you have the hacker mindset, I challenge you to join our <a href= "https://discord.gg/DNgheJRHFZ">hacker community</a> Discord channel where like-minded people continuously debate and learn from each other on various topic! Honestly, even if you are noobs, you'll benefit from this community, hehe 😏 See you there 😎👻
