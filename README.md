  <h2>Case study research on usability and user-retention of <a href="https://pathforge.co/feed/" target=blank>Pathforge</a></h2>
  <p align="justify">
  <a href="https://hackercollective.co/" target="blank">The Hacker Collective (THC)</a> aims to disrupt overpriced education, to get all the self-learners together on a single platform so that everyone can collaborate on projects, meet like-minded people, network with other self-learners, with no geographical boundaries. This led to them to develop a social-educational portal called Pathforge. 
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
  The goal of Pathforge is not to create content (i.e. not to be another Coursera, Udemy, or FreeCodeCamp). Rather, to curate contents and provide support for self-learners. Research shows that the main reason for online learning to fail is due to isolation. This motivated the developers to emphasize social and gamification elements in their portal.

  <h2>What is usability testing</h2>
  <p align="justify">
  SUMI is a rigorously tested and proven method of measuring software quality from the end user's point of view to gauge the relative idea of “usability” from a student's perspective. The advantages of e-learning systems are minimized if students do not use them, causing e-learning initiatives to often completely or partially fail despite their potential. Low performance and poor usability create unusable systems which are probably the single largest reason that they fail in actual use. 
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
  For this research, we will be using a moderated usability testing approach, assisted by an evaluation questionnaire to test the external usability of Pathforge portal.  
The aim is to get 50 respondents to do a moderated usability testing through an online call on Google Meet with an interviewer. The respondents will be requested to “think aloud” while completing some tasks on Pathforge. Afterwards, they will need to fill out an evaluation questionnaire to rate their experience using the portal.
The questionnaire is generated based on frameworks tested by past researches, such as the <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/26473991_WEB_SITE_PROJECTS_EVALUATION_-_A_CASE_STUDY_OF_ROMANIAN_FACULTIES_OF_ECONOMICS_WEB_SITES" target="blank">Web Assessment Index (WAI)</a> presented by Vultur and Marincas, <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238176321_Website_Quality_Evaluation_Method_a_Case_Study_on_Museums" target="blank">Website Quality Evaluation Method (QEM)</a> presented by Olsina et al, and the famous <a href="https://sumi.uxp.ie/" target="blank">Software Usability Measurement Index (SUMI)</a> presented by Dr Jurek Kirakowski. 
The questions are categorized into eight usability attributes based on the <a href ="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sonam-Mathur-3/publication/301824711_Demographic_Influences_on_Technology_Adoption_BehaviorA_Study_of_E-Banking_Services_in_India/links/5aec0c02458515f59981f28c/Demographic-Influences-on-Technology-Adoption-BehaviorA-Study-of-E-Banking-Services-in-India.pdf target="blank"">Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)</a> introduced by F. D. Davis (1986) to explain user’s acceptance of technology in education.
