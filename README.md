  <h2>Case study research on e-portal usability to troubleshoot user-retention issue of <a href="https://pathforge.co/feed/">Pathforge</a></h2>
  <p align="justify">
  <a href="https://hackercollective.co/">The Hacker Collective (THC)</a> aims to disrupt overpriced education, to get all the self-learners together on a single platform so that everyone can collaborate on projects, meet like-minded people, network with other self-learners, with no geographical boundaries. This led to them to develop a social-educational portal called Pathforge. 
  </p>
  <p align="justify">
  The goal of Pathforge is not to create content (i.e. not to be another Coursera, Udemy, or FreeCodeCamp). Rather, to curate contents and provide support for self-learners. Research shows that the main reason for online learning to fail is due to isolation. This motivated the developers to emphasize social and gamification elements in their portal.

  <h2>What is usability testing</h2>
  <p align="justify">
  SUMI is a rigorously tested and proven method of measuring software quality from the end user's point of view to gauge the relative idea of “usability” from a student's perspective. The advantages of e-learning systems are minimized if students do not use them, causing e-learning initiatives to often completely or partially fail despite their potential. Low performance and poor usability create unusable systems which are probably the single largest reason that they fail in actual use.

  <h2>What should you expect as a Website Tester</h2>
<p align="justify">
  you will need to get on a 30-minute online call where we will give you some task to perform on the portal. The tasks may be as such:<br>
    Create an account | Log in | Create a dummy content | Interact with contents | Navigate through the website | provide criticism | feedback | fill out an evaluation form | etc! It's pretty simple, and you will be guided along the way :)
  </p>
  
  <h2>What will you need</h2>
  ✅ internet connection &nbsp; ✅ laptop / desktop &nbsp; ✅ 30 minutes of time &nbsp; ✅ webcam &nbsp; ✅ mic
  
  <h2>Are you a hacker?</h2>
  <p align="justify">
  If you think you have the hacker mindset, I challenge you to join our <a href= "https://discord.gg/DNgheJRHFZ">hacker community</a> Discord channel where like-minded people continuously debate and learn from each other on various topic! Honestly, even if you are noobs, you'll still benefit from this community, hehe 😏 See you there 😎👻
